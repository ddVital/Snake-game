# Snake game

The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.

# How to play?
